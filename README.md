#Smooth Core Goals

##Whatâ€™s important for a positive working environment?

- transparency
use slack to communicate when necessary
standup three times a day (morning, lunch, dinner)
mixing in pairing with solo time
pomodoro maybe? up to individual
timeboxing tasks

- hours:
this week, core hours, try to leave by 10pm
sat: start at 11
sun: normal schedule
mon-wed: crunch time

##What do we want to get technically from this?

- learn payment systems and data-security (encryption)
- data analysis (data visualization, D3)
- full JS stack (rails api backup plan)
- mongo database
- testing in JS (Jasmine, etc)
- CSS frameworks, and responsiveness (PureCSS, SkeletonCSS, etc)
- Agile development
- Git Workflow and Best Practices
